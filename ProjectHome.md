The Balloon Flight Engineering Module (BFEM) is a prototype of the solid state pair-conversion/tracker currently onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope LAT. The now disused BFEM and associated hardware is to be repurposed as a development platform for detecting, reconstructing, analyzing and displaying cosmic ray air-shower events. This involves updating old software and developing new software for data system setup, data taking, analysis and display. The BFEM will continue to be a valuable educational tool, to be improved upon by subsequent undergraduates and possibly used as an outreach device for the general public in science museums.
